PHPCR Decorator
===============

Proxy implementation of PHPCR which enables you to decorate (a.k.a wrap) any
classes.

For example, you can use this library to decorate all `NodeInterface` classes
in a custom node class (or even instantiate domain classes based on node types
for example).

The wrapper is genereated via `/bin/generate.php`.
